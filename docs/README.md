# Filecoin Documentation

**Filecoin is a peer-to-peer network that stores files on the internet, with built-in economic incentives to ensure files are stored reliably over time.**

**Filecoin 是一种将文件存储在互联网上的点对点网络，具有内置的经济激励措施以确保文件随着时间的推移可靠地存储。**

Available storage and pricing is not controlled by any single company. Instead, Filecoin facilitates open markets for storing and retrieving files that anyone can participate in.

存储空间和价格不受任何公司的控制，相反，Filecoin提供了一种所有人都可以参与的，能够促进存储和检索的开放市场。

The **Filecoin project documentation** homepage offers all the necessary resources to learn about Filecoin, the software and the tools to contribute to the network, either as a user looking for storage, or as a miner providing it. Here are some links to get you started:
